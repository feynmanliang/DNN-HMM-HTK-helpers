DNN-HMM Investigations with HTK
==============================

This repository implements some shell scripts which investigate
the performance of DNN-HMM hybrid speech recognition systems built
using HTK.

Code depends on HTK 3.5.0 (pre-release as of 12/12/2015) and
University of Cambridge internal helper scripts. Since these are
not publically available, the purpose of this repository is to
archive the ZSH shell scripts.
